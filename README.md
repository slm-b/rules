# The Constitution of League

All following events will lead to the punishment of codependent or independent purchase of shots depending on severity of punishments. Only one round of shots may be purchased per game and none on the third game. Shots can be purchased preemptively. 
- *A. Missing the 5 pin and only the 5 pin. = 1
- B. The result of being the only person on the team to not strike “Getting Stuck”. = 1
- C. The combined rules of A and B. = 2
- D. Getting two gutters within the same frame. = 1
- E. When a coach** is present, 6 shots are purchased. The second stick during the same frame owes 3 (half) instead of 2. A third stick results in a rock paper scissors (best of 3) to determine who the third stick buys one (1) shot from.
 
*(Getting stuck can be stopped by someone with a handicap of 100 or more getting a spare.)

** A coach is any person that has played with the team previously or brings considerable experience too the team and assists the team with strat and gameplay.
